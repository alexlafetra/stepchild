graphical bugs/issues
-------------------------------------------
fix main menu wireframes 
    - moving too fast, autotrack one is buggy
    - mobius strip should have the mobius part move around
^^FIXED

reverse fx has pram overlapping its icon
^^FIXED

echo fx is too fast
^^FIXED
echo menu should have a preview of the note
strum menu too?

transition into instrument/app menu is too fast
^^FIXED

lines in MIDI menu can be seen thru empty muted ports
    - also, need a tooltip for muting ports
    - and a tooltip for channel filtering
    - and change the text for the "thru" toggling (should be off/on not thru/off) (maybe add an in-->port graphic? to show what thru means)
^^FIXED

quant menu grid/amount labels should always be visible (right now it's just when cursor is on them)
^^FIXED

rand menu needs an overhall
    - small die w/ dots on the right, options in a list? too much jumping around/can't view all settings at once
^^FIXED

moving tracks is visually very clunky (menu icon is weird, v empty)
need A/B knob indicators on sort menu, also looks v clunky
^^FIXED

need A/B tooltips on XY
^^FIXED

TINY visual glitch when scrolling to bottom of seq, view is extended even though cursor isn't on last frame
^^FIXED but this could use some refactoring

flicker when closing fx menu after opening an FX
^^FIXED

adding functionality
-------------------------------------------
change FX menu to be accessible from main seq directly
    - should be a list you can scroll down, with a quick desc. to the right of each item
    - no wireframe (even though it's cool, it can be a screen saver)
    - Shift+menu would be a good way to do it!
^^FIXED/ADDED

better PC editor controls period...maybe shift X jumps to next box?
^^FIXED (cursor jumps when in editing mode, now there's a tooltip)

note edit menu FX should be faster/maybe totally redone to look like the normal FX menu
^^DONE (just slides in FX menu)
also...maybe get rid of quantize and humanize icons? instead have a stencil, superposition/chop


refactoring/cleaning code
-------------------------------------------
fx should return true/false so that the FX menu knows whether or not to close after theyâ€™ve been triggered
    - refactor echo menu to return t/f if it echos a note (to allow for backing out of FX menu)
^^DONE -- Basically, FX menu checks if an FX has been run and if it has, it backs out to main seq immediately
//better to not have it jump out of FX menu, so ppl explore more fx and don't have to re-dive each time

bugs (broken features/crashes)
-------------------------------------------
moving loop in PC editor is bugged (looks like you reversed the controls)
^^FIXED
actually, ALL loop moving is busted
    - moving both loops triggers, but doesn't move w/ cursor
    - Moving loop start moves loop end
    - moving loop end moves both
^^FIXED

screensavers instantly quit?
^^FIXED (issue w/ areThereAnyButtons() always returning true)

exiting superpos editor opens track menus (should just go back to main seq, probably not resetting the encoder value correctly)
^^FIXED

Freeze when closing the track menu when viewing the last track
- AND the main menu! it's something about when the tracks unshrink bc those menus are unshrunk
- So some bounds must be getting messed up
^^FIXED

Freeze when selecting a scale
^^FIXED
