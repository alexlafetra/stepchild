# **Welcome to the Stepchild Code Docs!**

This is WIP documentation to aid in building custom applications and features for The Stepchild midi sequencer. These docs are intended to allow people to use existing functionality of the Stepchild's codebase to expand upon and develop the Stepchild.

## What these docs don't contain:
- All hardware documentation/build guides can be found [here]().
- Explanations and tips for using the default Stepchild Firmware can be found in the Stephild [manual]().

## What they do:
- Instructions for building the [headless]() version of the childOS software for Mac.
- Documentation of the major functions used by childOS
