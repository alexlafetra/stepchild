graphical bugs/issues
-------------------------------------------
fix main menu wireframes 
    - moving too fast, autotrack one is buggy
    - mobius strip should have the mobius part move around
^^FIXED

reverse fx has pram overlapping its icon
^^FIXED

echo fx is too fast
^^FIXED
echo menu should have a preview of the note
strum menu too?

transition into instrument/app menu is too fast
lines in MIDI menu can be seen thru empty muted ports
    - also, need a tooltip for muting ports
    - and a tooltip for channel filtering
    - and change the text for the "thru" toggling (should be off/on not thru/off) (maybe add an in-->port graphic? to show what thru means)

quant menu grid/amount labels should always be visible (right now it's just when cursor is on them)
^^FIXED

rand menu needs an overhall
    - small die w/ dots on the right, options in a list? too much jumping around/can't view all settings at once

moving tracks is visually very clunky (menu icon is weird, v empty)
need A/B knob indicators on sort menu, also looks v clunky

more obvious loop menu: loop info on Right side and prompt for (sel to edit loop)

files fly out too fast in file menu

adding functionality
-------------------------------------------
swing should be global by default, or can be "applied" to a range of notes/track
    - 'N' to create a swing functionality
    - Second swing screen w/tabs gone, just for creating swing curve
    - OR select an autotrack to grab swing from

Autotracks should be able to be overlaid/applied to the sequence
    - target note vel, note timing

change FX menu to be accessible from main seq directly
    - should be a list you can scroll down, with a quick desc. to the right of each item
    - no wireframe (even though it's cool, it can be a screen saver)
    - Shift+menu would be a good way to do it!
^^FIXED/ADDED

select box for PC messages
better PC editor controls period...maybe shift X jumps to next box?

instead of rand on main menu
    - liveloop?
    - CV?

note edit menu FX should be faster/maybe totally redone to look like the normal FX menu
^^DONE (just slides in FX menu)
also...maybe get rid of quantize and humanize icons? instead have a stencil, superposition/chop

menu should open a menu in the livelooper, which gives you the option to exit, but also other options

refactoring/cleaning code
-------------------------------------------
fx should return true/false so that the FX menu knows whether or not to close after theyâ€™ve been triggered
    - refactor echo menu to return t/f if it echos a note (to allow for backing out of FX menu)
^^DONE -- Basically, FX menu checks if an FX has been run and if it has, it backs out to main seq immediately
//better to not have it jump out of FX menu, so ppl explore more fx and don't have to re-dive each time

bugs (broken features/crashes)
-------------------------------------------
moving loop in PC editor is bugged (looks like you reversed the controls)
^^FIXED
actually, ALL loop moving is busted
    - moving both loops triggers, but doesn't move w/ cursor
    - Moving loop start moves loop end
    - moving loop end moves both
^^FIXED

Quantize fn is broken -- seems to delete notes when it shouldn't? quantizing same notes twice deletes them

screensavers instantly quit?
^^FIXED (issue w/ areThereAnyButtons() always returning true)

can't move notes if the distance is smaller than their length

exiting superpos editor opens track menus (should just go back to main seq, probably not resetting the encoder value correctly)
^^FIXED

controls on strum menu are a little weird

NEXT UPDATE:
multiple super position edit at once
